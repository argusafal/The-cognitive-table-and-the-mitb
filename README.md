# The-cognitive-table-and-the-mitb
hello you all this is my second program so we will see this program is about the mitb also called myers brigs personality test and the cognitive table combined if this you can view how you make decisions and the way you think so when you are finished checking your type and table come here again and i will will explain what each does
The Cognitive Table — All 16 Types, Explained with Mild Sarcasm

INTP – The Think Tank Gremlin

Stack: Ti > Ne > Si > Fe

Internal logic monster who'd rather debug reality than accept it. Social interaction is optional; thinking is mandatory.


INTJ – The Strategic Phantom

Stack: Ni > Te > Fi > Se

Knows how the world ends but won't tell you. Efficiency first, feelings later (if ever). Operates three years ahead of everyone else.


ENTP – The Chaos Researcher

Stack: Ne > Ti > Fe > Si

Weaponizes curiosity. Starts 10 projects, finishes none, but discovers a new universe in the process. Debates for fun.


ENTJ – The Vision Bulldozer

Stack: Te > Ni > Se > Fi

Has a spreadsheet for world domination. Thinks feelings are like software bugs—annoying but fixable.


INFP – The Daydream Paladin

Stack: Fi > Ne > Si > Te

Wandering through metaphors since birth. May cry during arguments but will win them spiritually.


INFJ – The Soul Hacker

Stack: Ni > Fe > Ti > Se

Sees your core wounds before you do. Speaks in prophecy, vanishes for a week to recharge.


ENFP – The Whirlwind Philosopher

Stack: Ne > Fi > Te > Si

A chaotic blend of deep feelings and spontaneous TED Talks. May start a cult by accident.


ENFJ – The Empathy Commander

Stack: Fe > Ni > Se > Ti

Feeds off emotional data like a social vampire. Organizes everyone’s lives while secretly overthinking.


ISTP – The Tactical Cat

Stack: Ti > Se > Ni > Fe

Can dismantle anything—including your argument. Emotionally MIA but will fix your car at 3 AM.


ISTJ – The Reliable Algorithm

Stack: Si > Te > Fi > Ne

Runs on tradition and internal rules. Has a mental Excel sheet for everything, including emotions.


ESTP – The Crisis Sprinter

Stack: Se > Ti > Fe > Ni

Lives in the moment, often shirtless. Expert in improv and avoiding long-term plans.


ESTJ – The Human Drill Sergeant

Stack: Te > Si > Ne > Fi

Wants results, structure, and no-nonsense. Thinks chaos is a personality defect.


ISFP – The Aesthetic Recluse

Stack: Fi > Se > Ni > Te

Feels everything. Quietly intense. Could be painting or punching a wall — it depends.


ISFJ – The Gentle Archive

Stack: Si > Fe > Ti > Ne

Your emotional historian. Remembers birthdays, trauma, and that thing you said in 2017.


ESFP – The Sparkle Gremlin

Stack: Se > Fi > Te > Ni

Sees life as a dance floor. Feels deeply, acts impulsively, parties responsibly (sort of).


ESFJ – The Emotional Manager

Stack: Fe > Si > Ne > Ti

The mother of every friend group. Good luck hiding anything from them — they sense it.
Here’s a breakdown you can include in your README that explains how each dominant and auxiliary function typically behaves — along with a side dish of humor. Then I’ll give you how demon functions act when they rise from the grave:

 MBTI Types: What Your Top Functions Say About You

 Thinkers & Feelers

Ti Dom (ISTP, INTP)

Lives inside a logical fortress. Constantly asking, “Does this make sense?”

Aux: Se (ISTP) – reacts in real-time like a ninja with receipts.

Aux: Ne (INTP) – ten ideas per second, most of them absurd but brilliant.

Joke: Probably tried to invent teleportation out of boredom.


Te Dom (ESTJ, ENTJ)

Treats life like a project plan. Deadlines? Sacred.

Aux: Si (ESTJ) – remembers exactly how Grandma did it (and she was efficient).

Aux: Ni (ENTJ) – sees 20 steps ahead and already has a war plan.

Joke: Will argue with a vending machine about productivity.


Fi Dom (ISFP, INFP)

 Feels everything. If it violates their values, it’s dead to them.

Aux: Se (ISFP) – lives in the moment, stylish and soulful.

Aux: Ne (INFP) – dreams in metaphors and poetic suffering.

Joke: Has cried over a sunset and judged you for not joining.


Fe Dom (ESFJ, ENFJ)

 Brain = idea popcorn machine. Everything connects (somehow).

Aux: Fi (ENFP) – deeply loyal to their identity, even mid-existential crisis.

Aux: Ti (ENTP) – debates for fun and to find the truth (maybe).

Joke: Could convince you to join a circus and major in clown science.


Si Dom (ISFJ, ISTJ)

Human archive. “That’s not how it’s done” energy.

Aux: Fe (ISFJ) – compassionate, warm, will bake you cookies and shame you politely.

Aux: Te (ISTJ) – competent as hell, and lowkey judging your chaos.

Joke: Has had the same phone wallpaper for 9 years.


Se Dom (ESFP, ESTP)

Pure reaction, full immersion. YOLO but calculated.

Aux: Fi (ESFP) – full of feelings and killer vibes.

Aux: Ti (ESTP) – troublemaker with a logic sword.

Joke: Will jump off the cliff just to test gravity themselves.

 Demon Function Behavior (when the system glitches)

These are the functions that crawl out only when you're stressed, cornered, or having a full-on existential meltdown.

Ti Demon: Over-analyzes everything until you can't move. Suddenly, logic is a weapon of mass self-doubt.

Te Demon: Controls everything with micromanagement panic. Becomes the boss no one asked for.

Fi Demon: Hyperjudgmental and emotionally triggered by everything. Nothing feels true anymore.

Fe Demon: Manipulates others or explodes trying to keep up fake harmony. Cringes at vulnerability.

Ni Demon: Creates delusional future fears. "The pattern says you're doomed and I BELIEVE IT."

Ne Demon: Sees connections that don't exist. Conspiracy theorist mode activated.

Si Demon: Gets stuck in a memory loop. Feels like time-traveling into childhood trauma.

Se Demon: Reacts impulsively. Might break something just to feel alive again.
